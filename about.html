                <h3>About the production process</h3>

                <h3>Oil quality control</h3>
                <p>We paid special attention to the quality of the oil used for frying side dishes in Burger Bars, using a unique device on the world market for filtering oil for frying VITO® and instruments for testing the quality of the oil, which is regularly changed accordingly. By using the VITO® device, the taste and quality of the food is improved, i.e., we serve our guests healthier deep-fried food that does not contain carbon, which is a product of the long-term use of frying oil. It has been proven that the use of VITO® devices has a positive effect on critical parameters such as Total Polar Matters - TPM.</p>
                <p id="tg-3" class="hide">Additionally, we regularly maintain and clean our cooking equipment to guarantee optimal performance and prevent any unwanted oil residue. By prioritizing oil control in our culinary process, we aim to offer a guilt-free indulgence for our customers, allowing them to savor the rich tastes of our burgers without unnecessary excess. At our restaurant, we believe that every aspect of the dining experience, including oil control, contributes to the overall satisfaction and well-being of our patrons.</p>
